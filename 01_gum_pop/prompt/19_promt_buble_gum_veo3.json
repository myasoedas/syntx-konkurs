  "prompt": "Hyperrealistic 8-second vertical video for Instagram/TikTok: A real 9-year-old streamer girl (gray eyes, fair skin, light brown hair) in a neon-lit streaming setup blows a huge pink bubblegum bubble. She points at the bubble with both fingers, wearing a clear 'No War!' badge (black on white) on her chest. The AERONYTE neon logo (style of logo-AERONYTE.jpg) is visible, with realistic glitch animation synced to the music beat. On-screen: real likes, donations, comments, and a challenge caption: 'Can you do this too?'. The camera smoothly zooms in from the left, focusing on the bubble and her face, capturing micro-expressions and neon reflections. The bubble fills most of the frame, tension rises—strictly photorealistic. Suddenly, the girl quickly ducks down, the bubble pops with a natural sound, and hyperrealistic water splashes shoot upwards, forming a brief, physical ‘mushroom cloud’ of water in macro detail, all with neon reflections—no cartoon or surreal effects. Water drops fall in slow motion, everything stays strictly real-world. Final frame: large AERONYTE neon logo, CTA: 'Listen to the new AERONYTE album—now on all music platforms! Subscribe and listen now!' All visuals and physics are strictly photorealistic. Ultra HD, real streamer setup, overlays, all effects synced with music (42-50 sec of provided track)."
