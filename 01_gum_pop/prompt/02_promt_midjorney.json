  "prompt": "A highly detailed cinematic anime-style scene of a young girl with long straight brown hair and expressive gray eyes, gently blowing a soft pink bubble gum while gazing into her reflection in a round glowing LED mirror. Her eyes shimmer with quiet emotion and belief. She wears a pastel-striped shirt and a white beaded bracelet on her wrist, with letters spelling 'MIRACLE'. The walls are soft pink with scattered yellow star stickers. In the background, a glowing dark blue poster features a neon red heart and the handwritten word 'AERONYTE' — the band she loves. On the mirror’s side, a hidden sticker reads 'AERONYTE Believe' near a small glowing crystal ball, subtly symbolizing magic and hope. The lighting is warm and ambient, from a sunset glow coming through soft curtains. The composition is vertical, designed for a 9:16 cinematic Instagram/TikTok frame, with clear top-to-bottom visual flow and emotional focus.",
