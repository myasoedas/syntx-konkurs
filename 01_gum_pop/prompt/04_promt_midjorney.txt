a close-up cinematic shot of a teenage girl blowing a bubblegum — the bubble is about to pop, glowing softly in pink light, macro details on stretched gum film, magical particles reflecting from the mirror behind her, a sticker “🔮 Believe” barely visible on the mirror, soft light rays enter the room through a window, her face calm and dreamy, eyes glowing slightly with grey sparkles, pastel shadows on her cheeks, background is her cozy bedroom with subtle fantasy elements melting in, the scene is frozen in the moment of transformation — the gum about to explode like a portal into a magical world, ethereal atmosphere, soft focus, dreamlike composition --v 6 --ar 9:16 --style raw --style photographic --quality 2 --chaos 20 --stylize 1000
