  "prompt": "Ultra-viral 8s hyperrealistic video for Instagram/TikTok/Yappy. 
  Real 9-year-old streamer girl (gray eyes, fair skin, light brown hair) in a stylish streamer room with pink-violet neon lights and haze. 
  She blows a huge pink bubblegum bubble, points at it with both fingers. On her chest: photorealistic 'No War!' badge (black on white). 
  Neon AERONYTE logo (style of logo-AERONYTE.jpg) in frame, realistic glitch animation synced to the beat. Camera: photorealistic, 
  smooth left-side zoom, focus on bubble and face, capturing micro-expressions and neon reflections. 0-1s: Girl starts blowing, 
  playful challenge vibe, live chat overlays, real likes, donations, comments on screen, 'Can you do this too?' caption. 1-3.5s: 
  Bubble covers half her face, tension, hyperreal skin and hair textures, anticipation in her wide eyes. 3.5-6.5s: 
  Bubble fills almost the whole frame, neon reflections, maximum excitement, close-up. 6.5-7s: Girl quickly ducks out of frame, 
  bubble pops with natural sound, hyperreal water splash forms a short, physical water 'mushroom cloud' 
  (macro, slow-mo, neon reflections, real physics, no cartoon or surreal effects). 7-8s: Water drops fall in slow motion, 
  all visuals strictly photorealistic. Final frame: large neon AERONYTE logo and caption: 
  'Listen to the new AERONYTE albumâ€”now on all platforms! Subscribe and listen now!'No cartoon, 
  no fantasy, only hyperrealism and authentic streamer vibe."
