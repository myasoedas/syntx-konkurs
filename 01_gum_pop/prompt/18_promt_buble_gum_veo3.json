  "goal": "Viral 8-second hyperrealistic video for Instagram/Yappy/TikTok: a real, beautiful 9-year-old streamer girl (gray eyes, fair skin, light brown hair) blows a huge bubble with pink bubble gum. In the frame: a realistic neon AERONYTE logo (strictly in the style of logo-AERONYTE.jpg), natural lighting, reflections, detailed skin and hair textures. Purpose: promote a new music release, engage the audience, gain new followers.",
  "audience": "Gen Z: school kids, students aged 7-24, social media users, challenge lovers, K-POP, anime, cyberpunk, pink neon.",
  "emotion_and_vibe": "Genuine streamer emotions: excitement, anticipation, playful challenge. Maximum engagement effect, realistic challenge vibe.",
  "style_and_references": "Hyperrealism! Everything looks like a real IRL stream: streamer desk setup, real neon lighting, detailed neon logo with glitch animation (flicker, digital glitches, bursts in sync with music beats). On-screen: real likes, donations, comments, pink cyber vibe, challenge caption: 'Can you do this too?'. Everything is strictly realistic, no cartoon or surreal effects.",
  "key_scenes_and_structure": "0-1s: Girl in a streamer room blows a bubble, points at it with both fingers, 'No War!' badge on her chest (realistic, black on white, clearly visible). 1-3.5s: Bubble covers half her face, camera smoothly zooms in, maximum emotion, realistic facial expressions. 3.5-6.5s: Bubble fills almost the whole frame, eyes wide open, tension, neon reflections in the bubble. 6.5-7s: Girl quickly ducks out of the frame, bubble pops, realistic water splashes (macro shot) create a short-lived water 'mushroom cloud'—obeys real physics. 7-8s: Water drops and splashes fall down in slow motion, neon reflections everywhere, no cartoon or surreal transformations.",
  "camera_and_lighting_details": "Photorealistic camera, smooth zoom, focus on bubble and face, left angle. Pink-violet neon lighting, some haze, dynamic light beams, glitch only on the logo. Water and bubble behave according to real-world physics: reflections, refractions, depth.",

Audio: 42-50 sec of https://cdn1.suno.ai/d9894627-d751-4418-a061-8fced64c5274.mp3 ('Life is joy, life is a miracle...'), realistic bubble, like, donation, emoji, and water macro sounds.",
