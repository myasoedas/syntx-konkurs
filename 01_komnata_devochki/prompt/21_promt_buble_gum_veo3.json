  "prompt": "Ultra-viral 8s hyperrealistic video for Instagram, TikTok, and Yappy, inspired by K-POP and streaming culture. Young cheerful streamer (preteen girl, gray eyes, light brown hair, fair skin) in a trendy neon streamer room with pink and violet lights and a light haze. She joyfully blows a large pink bubblegum bubble, pointing at it with both hands. On her T-shirt: a photorealistic positive message badge (black text on white background, for example 'Peace!'). In the frame: vibrant neon AERONYTE logo (in the style of logo-AERONYTE.jpg), with realistic digital glitch animation synced to music. Camera: high-detail photorealism, smooth zoom-in from the left, focusing on the bubble and her expressive, happy face, with neon reflections. 0-1s: Streamer starts blowing the bubble, playful challenge mood, real-time chat overlays, visible likes, donations, comments, and a caption: 'Can you do this too?'. 1-3.5s: Bubble expands, covering part of her face; anticipation and excitement in her eyes, natural skin and hair detail. 3.5-6.5s: Bubble grows to fill most of the frame, neon reflections, high-energy close-up. 6.5-7s: Streamer quickly leans out of the frame, bubble pops with realistic sound, and a dynamic splash of water rises in macro slow motion, forming a cloud shape (all effects strictly photorealistic, with neon reflections, no cartoon or surreal visuals). 7-8s: Water droplets fall in slow motion; every visual detail remains hyperrealistic and family-friendly. Final frame: large neon AERONYTE logo and a vibrant caption: 'Listen to the new AERONYTE albumâ€”now on all platforms! Subscribe and listen now!' All visuals are strictly appropriate, positive, and suitable for all ages. No cartoon or fantasy effects. Only authentic, joyful streamer energy."
